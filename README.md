# Match Margin

This feature highlights all the textual matches of token at the caret location in the Editor.

![Preview](https://github.com/sboulema/MatchMargin/blob/main/src/Resources/Preview.png)

As an example, when the focus is on a variable, all usages of that variable are highlighted and a marker is placed on the vertical scrollbar to indicate the position on the page where that variable is used.

## Ported
This is a ported version based on the original MatchMargin but with added Visual Studio 2022 support.
